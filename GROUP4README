Grading Level:
Same Grade 

Differences: 
	We did not implement notifications between users as we defined in our app release paper.
	We felt it was more important to add recurring events and have a night theme setting than to send out notifications to other users since this isn't a main capability of our app. Our app is meant to facilitate finding times where a group is free, not to message between people and plan these meetings.

Special Instructions:
	Cocoa Pods used 
	Firebase
	Need IOS 10+

	Could not test on iPhone 7 Plus as we did not have access to the right
	device, so constraints are in place but not tested. If run on simulator
	for iPhone 7 Plus, in Main.storyboard, the left side UIView inside the
	ContainerViewController should have a trailing space constraint set
	to 416 instead of 375 (for iPhone 7) to shift everything to the right
	place.
