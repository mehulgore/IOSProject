Grading Level:
Same Grade 

Differences: 
	We did not implement notifications between users as we defined in our app release paper.
	We felt it was more important to add recurring events and have a night theme setting than to send out notifications to other users since this isn't a main capability of our app. Our app is meant to facilitate finding times where a group is free, not to message between people and plan these meetings.

Special Instructions:
	Cocoa Pods used 
	Firebase
	Need IOS 10+
